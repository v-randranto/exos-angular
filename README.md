# MonProjet

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Issues
Run into a problem with exercice-d2 (Todo app) : at first use of the Todo service (that is displaying the tasks list), its methods work all right but when submitting the form, they wouldn't work as the tasks table is undefined. The table is initialised in the class component with 2 tasks :(.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
